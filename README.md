Background
As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, my task was to analyse employee data from the 1980s and 1990s. The project involves designing tables for a SQL database, importing data from CSV files, and performing various data analyses.

Repository Structure
This repository is organised into the following key components:

- ERD-quickDBD.png: An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing the database schema design.
- ERD-pgAdmin.png: An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing the database schema design.
- table schemata.sql: SQL scripts for creating the tables, including schema definitions, primary keys, and foreign keys.
- Data Analysis queries.sql: SQL queries for extracting and analyzing data from the database.
